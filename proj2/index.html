              <p>
                  Project 2: Mesh Edit has us work from the ground up in order to create a mesh editing tool. First we write some code to utilize Bezier curves and surfaces in order to render them correctly. 
                  We then implement data structures to help us navigate these meshes easily. Lastly we implement ways that we can edit these meshes, through different ways such as edge splits, adding and removing points, and loop subdivision. 
                  Overall these tasks taught us a lot of about how even simple objects are made up of many different meshes, and certain tricks in order to change and manipulate them to our liking.

              <b>
                  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
              </b>
              <p>
                  de Casteljau's algorithm is a way of evaluating Bezier curves. The algorithm accomplishes this by recursively evaluating a
                  curve of one less degree. Each level is a series of points connected by lines. These points are the linear interpolations
                  between every two points in the next highest level, which we calculated in this part by implementing linear interpolations and
                  going down the points. Since every two points creates one point in the next lower level, the number
                  of points goes  down by one every time. Eventually, only one point is left, and this point is on the bezier curve. To evaluate
                  the whole curve, you need to run this algorithm at
                  each linear interpolation point from o to 1. In this project, we evaluted a curve at every 0.005 units from 0 to 1.

              <b>
                  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
              </b>
              <p>
                  The de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces by treating nxn control points as n nx1 Bezier curves. Then we can
                  linearly interpolate between these curves to fill in this space. Since surfaces are 2D, we now specify parameters u and v, instead
                  of just t like in one dimension. So one specifies how far along one dimension to lerp, and the other specifies along the other
                  dimension, allowing the curve to be evaluated at all points. In our code, given nxn control points, we essentially copied part 1 and
                  treated the nxn control points as n curves of n points each, creating a final set of n points evaluated at u. Then we treated those n points
                  as the control points for a 2d Bezier curve, evaluated at v. The final point was then returned.

              <b>
                  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
              </b>
              <p>
                  To implement area-weighted vertex normals, we looked at how the examples iterated around the edges of a vertex using halfedges.
                  Then for each halfedge, we went to the corresponding face, and calulated its area. To calculate its area, we took the cross
                  product of two of its edges. The area is then equal to half the magnitude of the cross product. We then multiplied the area of the
                  face with the face's normal, and summed all of these weighted normals up, one for each face adjacent to the given vertex. Then, we
                  normalized this resulting vector and returned it. We used provided methods to calculate magnitudes, cross products, normals, and unit vectors.

              <p>
                  Basically, we followed the spec to a T, by first laying out all of the elements that would be affected by an edge flip. Each edge flip
                  involves 9 half edges, 4 vertices, 5 edges, and 2 faces. Then we set the half edge pointers, then vertex pointers, then edge pointers, and
                  finally face pointers. Each vertex, edge, and face only needed to have the correct halfedge set, but each of the 9 halfedges needed to have
                  its twin, next, face, edge, and vertex pointers set.

              <p>
                  The center flip looks off because the edges are simply drawing a straight line between vertices. However, the teapot is curved outward, so
                  two far away points have a straight line path that cuts into the teapot. So the top triangle is in shadow (normal is now pointing downward), 
                  and thus darker, while the 
                  bottom triangle is in light. The other flips have resulting triangles with normals not so different than the original, so their shading is consistent 
                  with nearby triangles.

              <p>
                  We did not need to debug at all, but we had to redo our element laying out since we realized
                  that clockwise vs counterclockwise traversal would change our code significantly. We caught this early, however, and no code needed to be be
                  redone.

              <p>
                  We implemented edge splitting in the same way as edge flipping, by laying out all of the affected elements in code, and reassigning all pointers
                  carefully. The only difference is that this time we also added new elements, by calling newHalfedge() and other provided methods. Then we made
                  sure that all pointers were correctly assigned. In total, we added 6 halfedges, 1 vertex, three edges, and 2 faces.

              <b>
                  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
              </b>
              <p>
                  We implemented loop subdivision by following the suggested route and comments. We first used the provided equations to compute the new positions of both existing vertices and
                  soon-to-be created vertices, storing the new positions in Vertex::newPostition and Edge::newPosition for existing and not-yet-existing vertices respectively. Then
                  we split every existing edge, filling in the newly created vertex's newPosition with the Edge's newPosition. Then we looped over all of the
                  edges again, flipping each new edge if it connected an old and a new vertex. Finally, we looped over all of the vertices again, replacing their position
                  with their newPosition.
              </p>
              <p>
                  We did not get this working on the first try. Our issue was that we were setting isNew to true for all 4 internal edges of a split, since we split all old edges and
                  we didn't want to split the two edges making up the original edge a second time. However, since the two edges making the original edge are then new edges connected to
                  an old and a new vertex, we were flipping them in the next step, when they shouldn't have been flipped. To fix this, we set the two edges making up an original edge to be old edges,
                  so the flipping loop would skip over them. Then we simply changed the splitting
                  condition to be if an edge's two points were both old vertices, as suggested by a staff member on edStem.
              </p>

                  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?

              <p>
                  As you can see, sharp corners are smoothed away in loop subdivision. The angular torus becomes smooth like a donut after 3 subdivisions, and the
                  smoothing continues after 3 subdivisions as well. However, by pre-splitting edges, we can preserve angles, as shown by the torus that has been
                  pre-split on one side. The pre-split side is much more hexagonal than the unmodified side, preserving the original shape.

                  Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.

                  The original cube is asymmetric because the nodes have different degrees. Here is the equation for the new position of existing vertices:
                  (1 - n * u) * original_position + u * original_neighbor_position_sum, where n is the degree of the vertex, and u also depends on the degree of the
                  vertex. So vertices of different degrees have a different equation governing how much they move. In the pre-split cube, every triangle on a face is
                  split, ensuring that every node has the same degree. As you can see, the cuboid becomes symmetric.
