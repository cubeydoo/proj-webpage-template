	<h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h2>
	<p>
		We are trying to create a computer representation of a fluid that moves and behaves like a fluid in real life. This is important because it helps test how aerodynamic planes and cars are, lets us predict the weather, and build infrastructure like dams and fluid piping. Without computer simulations, all models would have to be physically prototyped, which is difficult and expensive. Fluid dynamics is challenging because fluids are chaotic, meaning that small changes in initial conditions result in very different results. And there are a lot of parameters that all affect each other. Not only that, we don’t have the mathematical methods to directly compute solutions to the equations that describe how fluids behave, so we have to use simulation.
		Although fluids in real life are not incompressible, many applications of fluids do not rely on the compressibility of fluids and simulating an incompressible fluid is often a good approximation of the reality. Furthermore, this tradeoff is often taken when needing real time performance.
	</p>
	<br />

	<h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
	<!-- Walk through the ray generation and primitive intersection parts of the rendering pipeline.
	Explain the triangle intersection algorithm you implemented in your own words.
	Show images with normal shading for a few small .dae files. -->
	<p>
		Questions to answer:
		How do we efficiently find the nearest neighbors for the incompressibility constraints?
		What is a good-looking yet fast method of rendering a liquid from particles?
		</p>

<p>
		Plan to deliver:
		Real-time interactive simulation of a 2d fluid with at least 30 fps. This will be a basic simulation of water falling into a box, and we will have a demo  to add and swirl fluid in real time. We plan to simulate this by simulating many particles, and creating a shader that will color the area covered by these particles with water. We could also add rigid objects to show splashing (ripples) and buoyancy. We can measure quality/performance by using fps, resolution, and perhaps number of particles as metrics. These kinds of fluids are commonly used in video games, which is why we think it is feasible to make such a demonstration.
	</p>
	<p>

		Hope to deliver:
		If things go well and we get ahead of schedule, there are a couple of directions we can go in. One is fluid simulation in a beer bottle, with the bottle in various lighting environments. The fluid is also carbonated, so the liquid would have bubbles rising up. Another direction we could go is simulating a ferrofluid, which could be done by assigning a magnetic field to each particle, and creating magnetic rigid objects.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Schedule
	</h3>
	<p>
		Week 1<br />
		Start simulation. Set up development environment. Use Verlet integration to simulate particles.
		Literature review on our specific simulations
		Exploring how to use OpenGL to render simulated particles as no one has extensive experience with it.<br />
		Week2:<br />
		Work on shader for the particles. Think about metaballs or other ways of drawing liquid over particles, blending shapes, visually drawing surface tension.<br />
		Week 3:<br />
		Finish simulation, turn it into an interactive website that allows users to add objects and drag cursor through water.<br />
		Week4:<br />
		Work on presentation by creating a script or bullet points of important points to cover, practice presentation.<br />

	</p>
	<br />

	<h3>
		Resources
	</h3>
	<p>
		Because we plan on turning the project into a website, the most appropriate language to use would be javascript. However, for simulation speed purposes, we may also look into using c/c++ and having a local version run for the demo. We plan on using only our personal computers to develop this project.
